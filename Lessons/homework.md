# "Homework": recommended exercises for each week

## Week 1

1 What question do you want to answer in your course project? 

1 Write out your your expectations about the question:
    * Is it answerable?
    * Has someone already answered it?
    * Is the data needed to answer it available?

1 Based on what you found, ask a more narrow question that will set the path for your course project. It should be answerable with data that you can access.

1 Find a data set that will answer some form of your question, and load it into a pandas dataframe.

1 Describe the data fields in your data set: variable name and type.

1 Create at least one graph using your data. 

1 Describe the graph(s) you created. Identify the explanatory/response or dependent/independent variables. Did you discover any trends, expected or unexpected?
